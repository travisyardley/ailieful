Our young Scottish Fold was having serious troubles and was going to need surgery to remove an abnormally large stone from her bladder. One very long day and drugged up kitty later, Ailie was home safe and sound. We were happy to know she would be ok, but how could we stop this from happening again?

And just like that, we needed to take a very serious look at our cats' diets. Once we determined our nutritional requirements, we assumed it would be as simple as looking at some nutritional info on the sides of cans and picking the right numbers. The pet nutrition industry, however, is not set up with an informed consumer in mind...

This is a multi-program, functioning data pipeline for evaluating... cat food. Yeah. I know, it seems weird; but as it turns out this data set actually presents a number of interesting challenges: non-standardized itemization, differing or mixed systems of measurment, unlisted values that we'll need to derive. What started off as an afternoon on Excel quickly escalated, as the more I looked into this the more holes I uncovered.

At the heart of this project are three key programs: spidercat, tidycat, and vizcat.
